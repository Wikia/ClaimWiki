This includes the ability to block users from editing, protect pages from editing, delete pages, rename pages without restriction, and use certain other tools. You also have access to the [[Special:Analytics]] page with statistics about traffic to the wiki. We ask that you use these tools in the pursuit of excellence, and never for spiteful or personal reasons.<br/><br /> If you ever have any questions, comments, concerns, or any type of issue you’re not sure how to handle please feel free to contact the wiki team either via email at $4 or by leaving a message on a wiki administrator's talk page. Be sure to also check out the [https://help.gamepedia.com/Administrators_guide/ Administrators Guide].<br/><br/> If you are not already on it, we would also like to invite you to join us on the official Fandom and Gamepedia Discord. Discord is a messaging platform for teams, and joining our Discord is a great way for you, as an active editor, to keep in touch with our staff as well as other active editors and admins. You will need a Discord account. Here is the invitation link: [http://discord.gg/Fandom/ http://discord.gg/Fandom]<br/><br/> Congratulations, and welcome! <br/><br/> --$3<br/><br/>",
